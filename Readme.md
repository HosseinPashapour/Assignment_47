# 1 . Surgical  üè® ü©∫ 

+ In first problem I've done a classification on surgical database with perceptron.
perceptron algorithm is used for both classification and regression problems.
when we want to use it for classification, we must use an activation function to map our output to numbers that relates to our classes.

+ There are different activation function that we can use them in different situation for example: logestic(sigmoid),relu,step,tanh,...


+ then I calculate and plot confusion matric.

## How to Install
Run following commend :
```
pip install -r requirments.txt
```

## How to Run
```
Run Surgical.ipynb file in jupyter notebook
```


## Results

# 2.Weather Prediction ‚õÖ

+ weather dataset is the second dataset that I used it to test my perceptron algorithm.

+ At first I add another column to dataset for days. In fact I use 'Formatted Date' column to calculate the day number of each rows in a year, for example I use 12
for 2006-01-12 because this date is equal to 12th days in year.
+ then I calculate the mean temperature of each days in each years. and then I plot the temperature by day number for all years in dataset.

+ then I used another perceptron class to solve these regression problem. In regression problem we don't need activation function and we cant calculate accuracy.

+ So I use evaluate function to calculate loss and then I write a predict function that could predict temperature with day number.
for example you give 200 to it as input and it return the temperature of 200th day of year.

+ Finally I plot wieghts and biases and losses for training steps iterations.

## How to Install
Run following commend :
```
pip install -r requirments.txt
```

## How to Run
```
Run Weather.ipynb file in jupyter notebook
```
